scripts
==============

This repo contains a few Python and Z shell scripts I have written  
for my own personal use. I hope to add to it in the future as I  
learn more Python and improve my shell scripting.  

If you see something interesting, you're free to use/abuse/modify  
the code to your hearts content.
